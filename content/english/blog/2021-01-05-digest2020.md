* [Friends of OpenPGP](https://foopgp.org/about) appeared ðŸ˜‰.

* The [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/fr/product/yubikey-5-nfc/) finally [supports elliptic curves](https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016649139-YubiKey-5-2-3-Enhancements-to-OpenPGP-3-4-Support) *(There are now very few reasons to continue using [RSA4096](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) instead of [cv25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519))*.

* On [NitroKey](https://shop.nitrokey.com/shop/product/nk-sta-nitrokey-start-6)'s side. New firmwares now [support multiple identities](https://www.nitrokey.com/news/2020/new-firmware-multiple-identities-and-pgp-keys-one-nitrokey-start).

* [GnuPG](https://gnupg.org/) did 6 micro releases, up to [2.2.26](https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-announce/2020q4/000451.html). Reminder: [2.2.23](https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-announce/2020q3/000448.html) fixed a critical [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-25125).

* [Sequoia-PGP](https://sequoia-pgp.org/) developers announced [the release of version 1.0](https://sequoia-pgp.org/blog/2020/12/16/202012-1.0/)! ðŸ˜Š

* [Marcel Bokhorst](https://github.com/M66B/) did an [amazing work](https://github.com/M66B?tab=overview&from=2020-12-01&to=2020-12-31) again to make [FairEmail](http://www.faircode.eu/) so awesome.

* [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/) has been [greatly redesigned](https://blog.thunderbird.net/2020/07/whats-new-in-thunderbird-78/), and versions 78.x [no more need the Enigmail add-on to support OpenPGP](https://blog.thunderbird.net/2020/09/openpgp-in-thunderbird-78/). Big
changes implies [some little bugs](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=openpgp), but the user experience is already greatly improved, and 2021 should be a great year for Thunderbird.

* Despite some relevant reasons to not use [keys.openpgp.org](https://keys.openpgp.org), this keyserver reached [200 000 verified emails](https://keys.openpgp.org/about/stats).

* [KeyBase](https://keybase.io) who started by [providing services around OpenPGP](https://www.andreagrandi.it/2017/10/21/keybase-pgp-encryption-made-easy/), has been [acquired by Zoom](https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-acquires-keybase-and-announces-goal-of-developing-the-most-broadly-used-enterprise-end-to-end-encryption-offering/) (price [undisclosed](https://www.businessinsider.fr/us/zoom-acquires-keybase-security-build-end-to-end-encryption-2020-5)).

* [ProntonMail improves and provides more services around OpenPGP](https://protonmail.com/blog/).

* ["OpenPGP for XMPP" updated to 0.6.0](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0373.html).

* The [OpenPGP Working Group for the IETF](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/openpgp/about/) prepared 2 documents: a [revision of RFC4880](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-openpgp-rfc4880bis/) and a draft for the [Web Key Directory protocol](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-koch-openpgp-webkey-service/). We all hope that the [IETF](https://ietf.org/about/) will validate them during 2021.
