### Why the pug ?

Many of us were in associations that contributed to the success of the Linux kernel and free or open source software. These associations are often called LUG (*Linux User Group*).

From our smartphones to the routers and servers that run the Internet, including our cars and connected objects, Linux is today the core of most of the operating systems that surround our lives.

Linux now rules the world. The challenge that awaits us today is to make the world more fair and warmhearted.

For this we must be able to protect our privacy and avoid pyramid hierarchies as much as possible. This is exactly the vision and the goal of the men who invented [OpenPGP](/about/openpgp/).

PGP stands for *Pretty Good Privacy*, and today its most widely used implementation is GPG, which stands for *Gnu Privacy Guard*.

We then almost baptized ourselves PUG, which would have meant *Privacy User Group(s)*. At the end that acronym was gone, but the watchdog of our privacy remained.
