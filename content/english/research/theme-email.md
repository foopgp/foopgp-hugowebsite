### About Email

(TODO)

### OpenPGP-compatible email clients

Our suggestion of email clients that do support OpenPGP:

- For computers (Mac, Windows or GNU/Linux…):
  - [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/): Version 78 and later have integrated support for OpenPGP. Works on all major operating systems.
  - [Claws Mail](https://claws-mail.org/) (Windows, GNU/Linux)

- On Android:
  - [FairEmail](https://email.faircode.eu/) + [OpenKeychain](https://www.openkeychain.org/)
  - [K9 Mail](https://k9mail.github.io/) + [OpenKeychain](https://www.openkeychain.org/)


You can find lot more OpenPGP-compatible email software here:
